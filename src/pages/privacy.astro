        PassWorth values your privacy. We designed our iOS app to work without collecting
        any personal information from you.

      <h2>What We Collect</h2>
      <p><strong>We do not collect any personal data.</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Inputs you enter (prices, expected uses, etc.) are stored <strong>only on your device</strong>.</li>
        <li>No accounts, no trackers, and no third‑party analytics are used by default.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
      <p>All calculations happen locally on your device to show comparisons and savings. Data never leaves your device unless you explicitly export or share it.</p>

      <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
      <p>Your data is stored locally on your iPhone/iPad. Deleting the app will remove the stored data.</p>
